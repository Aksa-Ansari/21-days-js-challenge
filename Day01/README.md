# 🌸 Day 01 – Simple Number Problems  
   
🚀 Today I practiced some basic number problems using **loops** and **simple logic**.  
I revised how loops actually work and how a small change in logic can completely change the output 😄  
It was really fun to see how each problem helped me think step by step!

## 💻 Problems I Solved  
-  Print numbers from **1 to N**  
-  Print numbers from **N to 1**
