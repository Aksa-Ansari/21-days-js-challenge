# 🌸 Day 06 – Prime & Fibonacci  

Today I practiced working with prime numbers and the Fibonacci series in JavaScript.  
I learned how to check prime numbers, co-prime numbers, generate Fibonacci series, find the Nth Fibonacci number, and identify numbers within the Fibonacci sequence.  
This improved my understanding of number patterns and strengthened my logical thinking.

## Problems I Solved  
- Check if a number is prime  
- Check if two numbers are co-prime  
- Print Fibonacci series up to N terms  
- Find the Nth Fibonacci number  
- Check if a number belongs to the Fibonacci series  
- Print all prime numbers up to N  
- Find the sum of all prime numbers till N
