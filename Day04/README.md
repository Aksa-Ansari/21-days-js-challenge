# 🌸 Day 04 – Understanding Decimal Number System  

Today I practiced working with decimal numbers in JavaScript.  
I learned how to extract digits, separate whole and fractional parts, and even rebuild decimal numbers using only math no string methods.
It really helped me understand numbers more deeply and improved my logical thinking.

## 🔢 Problems I Solved  
- Split a number into digits using arithmetic operations  
- Remove the decimal point mathematically  
- Separate whole and fractional parts of a number  
- Count whole and fractional digits separately  
- Generate a decimal number from whole and fractional digits
