# 🌸 Day 05 – Factors & Multiples  

Today I practiced working with numbers in JavaScript.  
I learned how to find factors, multiples, HCF (GCD), LCM, count and sum factors, find the greatest factor, and check perfect numbers.  
This helped me understand number properties deeply and improved my logical thinking.

## Problems I Solved  
- Print all factors of a number  
- Print all multiples of a number up to a limit  
- Find HCF (GCD) of two numbers  
- Find LCM of two numbers  
- Count the total number of factors of a number  
- Find the sum of all factors of a number  
- Find the greatest factor of a number (other than itself)  
- Check if a number is a perfect number
