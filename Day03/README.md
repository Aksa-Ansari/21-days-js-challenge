# 🌸 Day 03 – Pattern Printing in JavaScript  

Today I practiced different pattern printing problems using nested `for` loops in JavaScript.  
It was fun to see how spaces and stars together can form different shapes like triangles, squares, and pyramids.

## Problems I Solved  
- Print Right-Angled Star Triangle  
- Print Inverted Right-Angled Triangle  
- Print Inverted Pyramid Pattern  
- Print Hollow Square Pattern  
- Print Hollow Pyramid Pattern  

## What I Learned  
- How nested loops control rows and columns  
- How to use spaces and stars to create aligned shapes  
- How to apply conditions to make patterns hollow or solid
