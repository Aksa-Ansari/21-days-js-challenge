# 🌸 Day 02 – Conditions & Logic  

 Today I practiced different conditional problems using `if`, `else if`, and `else` in JavaScript.  
I revised how decision-making works in a program, 
It was fun to see how combining multiple conditions helps in building real-life logic like bills, tax, and comparisons!


##  Problems I Solved  
-  Find the Maximum of Three Numbers
-  Check if a Number is Positive, Negative, or Zero  
-  Calculate Electricity Bill based on units  
-  Check if a Character is a Vowel or Consonant 
-  Check if a Year is a Leap Year


##  Extra Practice Challenge  
-  Check if a Character is Uppercase, Lowercase, Digit, or Special Character
-  Check Triangle Type Using Sides and Angles
-  Calculate Income Tax Based on Slabs
